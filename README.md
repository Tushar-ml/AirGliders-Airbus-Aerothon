# AirGliders-Airbus-Aerothon-3.0

We developed a WebApp by using HTML, CSS, Django, JavaScript, Flask, Machine Learning, AI, sqlite3. Flask, HTML, CSS, Django, JavaScript and sqlite3 were used to build frontend and backend and few functionalities of that WebApp. Machine Learning was used for Application Navigation in voice search , AI was used for Chat Bot. Sqlite3 was used to collect necessary information from Bug Report and Application Improvement functionalities.

Moreover, we added extra functionality in Application Improvement by adding Sentiment analysis using Machine Learning.
